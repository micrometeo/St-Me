# St-Me: A Profile-wise, Ultrasonic Anemometer and SODAR/RASS Aware Meteorological Processor


## Necessity addressed

Meteorological processors are computer programs whose main purpose is to produce the meteorological input of atmospheric dispersion models. Other secondary purposes may also exist, like data quality assessment, or the production of "scientific" information.

Many meteorological processors exist and are publicly accessible as open-source or source-inspectable code, AERMET and CALMET two examples. Some meteorological processors have also been developed in private companies, and sold as part of their modelling suites.

The problem behind these processor is their attempt to get the minimum set of meteorological data (for example
